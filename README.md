# FAI_AIRLINE_PREDICTOR

This project implements ML models such as Linear Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and ANN to predict airline ticket prices based on various features like airline, source, destination, duration, and stops. The dataset used for this project is [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadbinimran/flight-price-prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadbinimran/flight-price-prediction).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo in your local machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BanuTej007/FAI_AIRLINE_PREDICTOR
```

2. Install the required dependecies using the below commands
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Output

This project automatically saves the predicted prices generated by each machine-learning model.
After training, each model (Linear Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and ANN) is used to make predictions on the test dataset.

For convenience and further analysis, these predictions are exported as separate CSV files, one for each model.

The saved files follow this structure:

* linear_regression_predictions.csv

* random_forest_predictions.csv

* ann_predictions.csv

### Performance Results
